Setting up your environment
---------------------------

The easiest way to start working with this code is to set up a virtual
environment and run ``env/bin/python setup.py test``.  That will install
the necessary testing tools and run the tests.  Unfortunately it installs
them as eggs at the top-level which doesn't always seem to work.  If it
blows up with a strange looking error, manually install ``tox`` into the
environment using ``pip`` and it should work as expected then.

You can also just install the requirements from *dev-requirements.txt*
to get all of the expected tools available in the virtual environment.
