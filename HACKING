Setting up your environment
---------------------------

The easiest way to start working with this code is to set up a virtual
environment and run ``env/bin/python setup.py test``.  That will install
the necessary testing tools and run the tests.  Unfortunately it installs
them as eggs at the top-level... not perfect.  If this bothers you as
much as it bothers me, you can create the virtual environment and use
**pip** to install the requirements from *dev-requirements.txt* into the
virtual environment.
