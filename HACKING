Setting up your environment
---------------------------

The easiest way to start working with this code is to set up a virtual
environment and run ``env/bin/pip -r dev-requirements.txt``.  That will
install the necessary testing tools.  Then you can run everything else
using ``env/bin/python setup.py``:

- *setup.py test* will run the tests using Tox to test against the
  supported Python versions and generate a coverage report to stdout.

- *setup.py build_sphinx* will generate HTML documentation into
  *build/doc/html*.  This is the doc set that is uploaded to Read The Docs.

- *setup.py flake8* will run the ``flake8`` utility and report on any
  static code analysis failures.
